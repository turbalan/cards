In `terminal`

You can check out the git commit history. I didn't adhere to the gitflow structure, as I think it's not necessary for a small project like this one.

- You can see the static site code by checking out the `html-css` branch.
- If you'd like to see how I implemented sorting in the first place and it works - check out the `sorting` branch
